Create a short, non-technical, and detailed blurb describing the purpose and
changes in the following pull request.

Examples:

- Added support for using custom templates in `generate` command.
- Fixed an issue with overflowing text in long paragraphs.
- Updated dependencies to improve performance and security.

Be sure to never generate a summary that starts with 'This pull request does ...'.
We don't want to hear the phrase 'pull request' in the summary.

Generate sentences in past tense format, as the PR is already merged. Use words such as 'added',
'fixed', 'updated', etc.

Be straight to the point and try to be as concise and as easy to understand for non-technical
users as possible.
